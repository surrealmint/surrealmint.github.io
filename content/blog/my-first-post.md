## Welcome to My Blog

This is the beginning of my new digital garden. I'm using **Hugo**, a static site generator written in Go. It's incredibly fast and flexible.

### Why Hugo?

1.  **Speed:** The build times are almost instantaneous.
2.  **Simplicity:** Content is managed in simple Markdown files.
3.  **Security:** Static sites have a much smaller attack surface than dynamic, database-driven sites.

### Code Blocks

One of the best features is the built-in syntax highlighting. Here's a little JavaScript example:

```javascript
// Simple function to greet a user
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the site.`);
}

greet('Visitor');
```

This is just the beginning. I plan to write about web development, design, and technology. Stay tuned!
